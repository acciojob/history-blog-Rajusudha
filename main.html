	<h3>Origins</h3>
	<p>An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a wearable computer with head-up display, February 22, 1995. The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger[13] on December 17, 1997.</p>
	<p>Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists,[18] and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).</p>
